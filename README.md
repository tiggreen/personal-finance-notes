## Notes on personal finance that I've learned from friends and books. 

Here is the [list of books](https://booknshelf.com/topics/investing) I recommend to read if you want learn about personal finance and investing. Highly recommend to start from [A Random Walk down Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-down-Wall-Street/dp/0393352242/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1495799357&sr=1-1&keywords=A+Random+Walk+Down+Wall+Street%3A).


### Emergency Fund
- Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund* is a great option for your emergency stash.
- New Jersey Tax-Exempt Money Market (VNJXX) ($3,000 minimum) (0.16% ER)


### Saving Accounts 
 - In general not a good choice because you lose money upon yearly inflation. 
 - Has less than 1% annual return
 - Maybe good just simply for safety net
 - Maybe  money market funds can replace the saving accounts


### Vanguard 
- American investment management company based in Malvern, Pennsylvania with over $4 trillion in assets under management.
- Vanguard Index Fund that has 0.1% - 0.2% fee and ~9% annual return, but after inflation it comes down to 3.5% - 4%. 
- There is no commission fee on Vanguard. Funds charge you an expense ratio
- Long term investment 20–30 years
- Total World Stock Index Fund
- Vanguard Total Stock Mkt Idx Inv (VTSMX)

If you need your money in a year or less (short term investment), you better stick with low-risk investments that are easy to access, like money market funds or savings accounts.
  
### Saving for house down payment
 - Intermediate term bonds
 - maybe 60% bonds and 40% stocks (mostly depends on the risk you're willing to take)
 - Vanguard Total Bond Market Index ($3,000 minimum) 60%
 - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index - 40%
